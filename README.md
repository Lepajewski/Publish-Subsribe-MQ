# Publish-Subsribe-MQ

This project consists of broker and client sources.
Communication between these relies on message queues.
Broker handles message transfer and delivery.
Client publishes messages on a given topic and subscribe given topics.
Multiple clients can subscribe the same topic and publish and receive messages form this topic.

# Broker functionalities

- read and parse config file
- receive messages on a given topic
- insert message to a topic
- register new clients
- every client has unique id (given or randomly generated)
- ping client after *keepalive* time and no messages were delivered to check if it is still connected
- send and receive signals from clients
- messages are not ordered
- every message is delivered at most once

# Client functionalities

- read and parse config file (gets broker ip and port from there)
- connect to a broker
