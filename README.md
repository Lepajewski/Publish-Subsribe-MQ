# Publish-Subsribe-MQ

This project consists of two parts: broker and client library.
Communication between client & broker relies on message queues.
Broker handles message transfer and delivery.
Client publishes messages on a given topic and subscribe given topics.
Multiple clients can subscribe the same topic and receive the same message.
Multiple clients can publish on the same topic.

# Broker functionalities

- read and parse ``broker.conf`` config file
- receive messages on a given topic
- insert message to a topic queue
- register new clients
- every client has unique id (given or randomly generated)
- ping client after *keepalive* time and no messages were delivered to check if it is still connected
- send signals to clients as acknowledgements - callbacks
- messages are not ordered
- every message is delivered at most once

## Broker configuration

Broker can be adjusted in **config.h** file.
Inside, listener port and ip can be configured.
